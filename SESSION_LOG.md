# Session Log

## Session: 2026-01-02 - Initial Setup
**Agent**: Claude Opus 4  
**Tasks Completed**:
- Created scannable README.md for quick context recovery
- Created ARTIST_STATEMENT.md with sublingualism concept (Buddhist angle, raga, suspension between knowing/not-knowing)
- Created SECURITY.md for credential management protocol
- Added social media management to agent responsibilities

**Key Decisions**:
- Foregrounded linguistic aspect of sublingualism, backgrounded medical metaphor
- Incorporated Buddhist philosophy: direct access vs mental formations
- Embraces raga (attachment) rather than seeking its dissolution
- Vimeo piece noted as anchor work
