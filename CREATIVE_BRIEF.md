# Creative Brief

## Tone & Voice
- Self-deprecating, wry, not academic
- Psychedelic element is underplayed — should come through more
- Buddhist framework is real (vipassana practitioner) but shouldn't be explicit — let it inform without naming itself
- "You don't need to chew too much on my work" — sublingual pun, ironic, sets the right tone
- The work should feel absorbed, not analyzed

## Website Strategy
- Works page shows only very short segments — teasers, not the actual work
- The work is not meant to be consumed on the web
- Most of the work is stereoscopic and requires proper viewing equipment
- Orientation is toward installations where glasses can be distributed
- Preferred stereo methods: active shutter or XR (Viture etc.) — not red/green anaglyph
- The website is an invitation, not a gallery

## Installation Context
- Stereoscopic 3D is central to the work
- Most viewers don't have the right tools at home
- The goal is controlled environments where the experience is complete
- Distribution of viewing hardware (glasses) is part of the installation
